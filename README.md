NextGen-Public-Uploader
=======================

# DEVELOPERS NOTE

Master branch is currently "halfway" between copy found on WordPress.org and NextGEN Gallery 2.x compatibilty. It has had a lot of cleanup and reworking of overall code, but is not fully working for proper upload processing. Basically, it needs some TLC.

NextGEN Public Uploader is an extension to NextGEN Gallery which allows frontend image uploads for your users.
